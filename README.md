## Points to Ponder
1. In Next.Js _app.js is your root path and index.Js is the component while in react it is opposite.
2. flex is used to align the div on the canvas
3. flex along with justify-center will make the content center along the x-axis
4. flex along with items-center will make the content center along the y-axis

### This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
